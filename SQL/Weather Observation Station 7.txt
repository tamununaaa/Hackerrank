Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The STATION table is described as follows:
            CITY
    FIELD            TYPE
    ID               NUMBER
    CITY             VARCHAR2(21)
    STATE            VARCHAR2(2)
    LAT_N            NUMBER
    LAT_W            NUMBER
 
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Answer.
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' 
OR CITY LIKE '%u';
