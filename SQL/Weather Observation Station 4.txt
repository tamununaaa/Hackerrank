Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
The STATION table is described as follows:


            CITY
    FIELD            TYPE
    ID               NUMBER
    CITY             VARCHAR2(21)
    STATE            VARCHAR2(2)
    LAT_N            NUMBER
    LAT_W            NUMBER
 
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query returns 1, because .
total 4 of records - number of unique city names = 3-2 = 1

Answer.
SELECT COUNT(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY)) FROM STATION;
