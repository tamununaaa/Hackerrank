Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

Column          Type
employee_id     INTEGER
name	        STRING
months	        INTEGER
salary	        INTEGER

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is their monthly salary.

Answer. 
SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY NAME;
